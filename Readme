Problem Statement 1: Advanced Array Operations

You need to implement a console application that performs advanced operations on an array of integers based on user input. The program should provide a menu using a switch case statement.

Requirements:
Prompt the user to input a list of integers (comma-separated).
Present a menu with the following options:
1. Calculate Median
2. Find Second Largest Element
3. Check for Palindrome Array
4. Rotate Array Left
5. Exit
Validate user input for both the array of integers and the menu selection.
Display appropriate error messages for invalid input.

Detailed Specifications:
Calculate Median: Output the median of the numbers in the array. If the array has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle numbers.
Find Second Largest Element: Output the second largest unique number in the array. If there is no second largest, display a suitable message.
Check for Palindrome Array: Check if the array is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward). Output a message indicating whether it is or not.
Rotate Array Left: Shift all elements of the array to the left by one position. The first element should move to the end of the array. Output the new array.
